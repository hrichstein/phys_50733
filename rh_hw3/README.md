**Code for Problem 1**

This program reads in a grid of data and outputs a density plot showing a 
silicon surface.

*Related File*

"stm.txt", the file with the data used to create the plot.

*Output for Problem 1*

A .png file showing the density plot.

**Code for Problem 2a and 2b**

This program implements two functions using different equation forms to solve
for the roots of the quadratic equation.

**Code for Problem 2c**

This is a program which should accurately calculate both roots of a quadratic
equation. It tries to account for issues with machine precision.

*Output for Probelm 2*

The outputs for the three different Python functions I defined to solve the
quadratic equation 0.001x<sup>2</sup> + 1000x + 0.001.


**Code for Problem 3**

This program uses Debye's theory of solids to calculate the heat capacity of a
solid at temperature T, with volume V, density rho, and Debye temperature
debye_t. It uses the trapezoidal rule to calculate the integral.

*Output  for Problem 3*

A .png file showing the plot of Heat Capacity(J/K) vs Temperature (K)

**Code for Problem 4**

This program calculates the values of an integral from 0 to 3 in steps of 0.1
using Simpson's method. It then plots the integral as a function of x.

*Output for Problem 4*

A .png file showing the value of the integral as a function of time.
