**Code for Problem 1a**

richstein\_hw6\_prob1a.py

This script plots the motion of a nonlinear pendulum using the 4th-order Runga-Kutta method. It first shows theta as a function of time and then creates a series of .png files showing the motion of the pendulum.

*Output for Problem 1a*

richstein\_rk\_plot.png:
Plot showing theta vs. time, using Runga-Kutta.

richstein\_rk\_animation.gif:
Gif showing the motion of the pendulum every 25 time steps, using Runga-Kutta.


**Code for Problem 1b**

richstein\_hw6\_prob1b.py

This script plots the motion of a nonlinear pendulum using the Leapfrog Method. It first shows theta as a function of time and then creates a series of .png files showing the motion of the pendulum.

*Output for Problem 1b*

richstein\_lf\_plot.png:
Plot showing theta vs. time, using Leapfrog Method.
